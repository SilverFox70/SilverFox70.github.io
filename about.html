      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2></h2>

      <article class="main_article">
        <p>Originally an East Coaster, I moved out to San Francisco from Boston in 2012.</p>

        <p>I got into skiing back when it still snowed out here in the Sierras.  I'm not good
          at it, mind you, but it's fun!  I admit that some of my friends think I am crazy for
          trying to pick-up skiing in my 40's, but I say "why not?".  I am always up for learning 
          to do something new. I have always enjoyed playing and writing music, and
          back when I was younger played in several local rock bands in the Boston area.  These
          days one of my favorite Saturday afternoon past-times is to set up my smoker and make
          brisket, pork shoulder, or ribs.
        </p>

        <p>I started out my collegiate life as an actor, but quickly decided that I was better
          suited to all things "behind-the-scenes", not because I didn't enjoy being on stage,
          but because I enjoyed the blending of art and technical science that goes on off-stage.
          After receiving a BFA in Theatre Arts from Boston University, I landed a job at the
          then very young performance art show, Blue Man Group.  I had the opportunity to work on
          some of the special effects projects which piqued my interest in electronics engineering
          and computer programming.  I started a second Bachelor of Science in Electronic Engineering
          at Wentworth Institute of Technology, but I quickly landed a promotion at work and decided
          to leave that program.
        </p>

        <p>Quirky fact: I actually prefer stale red licorice over it being soft and fresh.  I'll open
          up a pack of Redvines and let it sit for a day or so just to make it a little more chewy.  I 
          used to have a passion for JuJuBees, but then they went and changed the recipe to make it
          softer.  I miss those hard, chewy nuggets which were the mortal enemy of fillings.
